Deep learning models for classifying birdsong

NOTE: the various trained models are run (currently manually via colab) and stored it the `/models` folder - from which location they are compiled into headers and stored by release for inclusion into [tinyspot(s)](https://github.com/tinyspot).

This repo then is all about producing (and assessing) the performance of these versions of the models and making sure they are ultimately "tracable" for why a particular species is correctly/incorrectly identified.
