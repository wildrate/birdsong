Deep learning models for classifying birdsong

This repo is all about producing and assessing TensorFlow models (not yet TFLite!).

NOTE: the output of this - as various trained models - are stored it separate `tinymodels` folder - from which location they are converted, optimised and compiled into headers and stored by release for inclusion into [tinyspot(s)](https://github.com/tinyspot).
