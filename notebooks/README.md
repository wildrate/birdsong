# Notebooks

These are colab notebooks - see the following advise for loading/running/pushing back changes [here](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

Basically though:
* Click [here](http://colab.research.google.com/github) and select `birdsong` repo and the notebook you want.
* Edit/run the notebook.
* If you get a satisfactory result or improvement - do 2 things:
  * Ensure that a respective model is written to the `tinymodels` repo by running the final bit of code in the notebook
  * Save the notebook by (in the colab browser) choosing the menu option File->Save a Copy in github

At the pop-up make sure to choose the right repo, branch and file to overwrite. Add a commit message.
(This might seem a bit weird, but ultimately it over-writes the existing file with a new version).
